# Universal DB Backend

This repository demonstrates how the **same backend use case**
can be implemented using:

- MySQL (relational model with JOINs)
- MongoDB (document-based model)

Implemented in:
- Java (Spring Boot)
- PHP (modular backend)

The business logic and API contracts remain the same;
only the data access layer changes.

This repo is designed to reflect
**remote contract–style backend development** with
clear structure, documentation, and incremental commits.
